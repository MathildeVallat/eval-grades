## Question 1
Load the data set.

```{r}
grades <- read_delim(here("data", "grades.csv"))

```

## Question 2
Give the number of grades in the data set directly in the text of your quarto file, in a sentence of the form “The data set contains xxx grades.” where xxx is replaced by the number of grades. This must be computed from the data set.

```{r}
total_grades <- nrow(grades)
total_grades
```

The data set contains 44195 grades.
